# classify-pv-faults-using-ml
The objective is to conduct a comprehensive fault analysis of a photovoltaic (PV) array by intentionally introducing faults and subsequently studying the resulting voltage-current (V/I) characteristics. This process involves simulating various faults within the PV array and monitoring their impact on its electrical behavior. To enhance the efficiency and accuracy of fault detection, a machine learning model is employed for fault classification. Once a fault is detected and classified, the system is designed to transmit an alert message. However, a significant challenge in this endeavor is the elimination of false fault detections to ensure that only genuine issues are reported. Resolving this issue is crucial to minimize unnecessary alerts and ensure that genuine faults are promptly identified and acted upon, ultimately optimizing the reliability and performance of the PV system.
